## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

>This starter code is just some simple faces being drawn. 

This code is a p5.js creation that aimed to display a randomised collection of parametised faces, alluding from aesthetics of classic betty boop, steamboat willie and cuphead animation. I mixed this inspiration with my own cartoon drawing style and each face is at a Â¾ view and features large eyes, a nose, mouth, ear and an extra accessory. These features are highly expressive and take up most of the space of face itself.

These faces are arranged in a 70s wallpaper like pattern and feature many emotions depending on the combination of each of the facial feature variables. I really like how much of a range of expression there is and it looks as if they are reacting to each other at times.


I added five new files to this code to keep my work clean and readable.

The files are:
ear.js
extra.js
eyes.js
mouth.js
nose.js

Each of these files contain my parameters and their variations.

My parameters are:
ear type, 4 variations (discrete)
extra type, 4 variations (discrete)
eyes type, 4 variations (discrete)
mouth type, 4 variations (discrete)
nose type, 4 variations (discrete)

Each of these parameters were featured in the arrangement code using weighted disturbutied for each of their 4 variations. Each parameter has different percentages for their variations, spending on the design.
