## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

>This starter code is just some simple faces being drawn. 

30/03

Played around with the code, picked my colour pallette and have start4ee drawing my face. Lots to come

04/ 04

Started off experimenting with creating a ‘base face’. I think my lines are too thick, but I’m happy with the style that I’ve settled on. I think I will have to keep in mind how little change I can have on the eyes as I feel it could easily depart from the theme I’m looking for. I also really like the ¾ facial view, it features only one ear and provides a different angle then the standard front on view. Could also provide some interesting styles for hair.

I’ve settled on these brown and beige colours to create a vintage effect for the faces. This could change over time, but I don't think I will depart from the theme of brown and beige. I am also conscious of changing the face colour as i don’t want to only represent white people as that isn't ethical.

I might also change how big the face is in regard to the bounding box as it does not exactly leave much room for hair or hats, and might also be a tight squeeze when trying to pair the faces next to each other. I think I’ll just have to experiment with this later on as I go. 

12/04

changed the thickness of the lines, and I got rid of the chin as well. I’ve also started to created different types of mouths, and they physically change when using one of the sliders. (took me a while to figure that out). My next steps are to do this process for the ears, eyes, nose and perhaps hair/hats . I might have to scale down everything for the hair if i do decide to include it. 

I quite like the idea of including little accessories or just things that add to a pose of the face, such as the music note. I’m wanting to develop these further. 
I also want to think about including some sort of shadow to make the image pop, as it is rather plain.
